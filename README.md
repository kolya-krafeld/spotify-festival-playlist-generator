## What is the Festival Playlist Generator?

You can create a Spotify playlist for your next music festival using the **Festival Playlist Generator**. Simply login with your Spotify account and upload a festival line up image or insert the artists you want to add into a textfield. The Festival Playlist Generator selects the artists' top tracks and creates a Spotify playlist for your Spotify account.
